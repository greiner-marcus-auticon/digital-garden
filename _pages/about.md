## About this garden ðŸŒ±

This is a digital garden, a collection of notes, thoughts, and ideas that are constantly evolving. It's a place for me to think out loud and document my learning journey.

I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build this garden, and I'm inspired by the work of [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) and [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/).

If you're curious about the tools I'm using, you can find the source code for this garden on [GitHub](https://github.com/greiner-marcus-auticon/digital-garden).

Thanks to [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt).

If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to chat, feel free to [reach out](/contact). I'd love to hear from you! ðŸŒ¿
